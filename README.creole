=SkrivArk=

SkrivArk (or simply "Ark") is a new kind of wiki software. It's a simple tool to create hierarchical pages of text.


==Install==
SkrivArk is developed on top of the [[http://github.com/Amaury/Temma|Temma]] framework and the [[http://github.com/Amaury/FineBase|FineBase]] library.

You'll also need a MySQL database and a Memcache server.

Use the **etc/database.sql** file to create the database.

Then create an administrator user by running this SQL request :
{{{
INSERT INTO User
SET admin = TRUE,
    name = 'Your name',
    email = 'your.email@domain.com',
    password = MD5('your password'),
    creationDate = NOW();
}}}

Set full read-write access to 'log/' and 'tmp/' directories:
{{{
chmod 777 log tmp
}}}


==Configuration==
Adapt the **etc/temma.json** configuration file:
* Define the database DSN (MySQL server only).
* Define the cache DSN (Memcache server only).

If you want to enable comments on the pages, you need to set up an account on [[http://disqus.com/admin/signup|Disqus]].
Copy the defined site shortname in the configuration file.


==Test it==
There is a demonstration site: [[http://arkdemo.skriv.org]]
* login: demo@demo.com
