=SkrivArk=

SkrivArk (or simply "Ark") is a new kind of wiki software. It's a simple tool to create hierarchical pages of text.

==Install==
SkrivArk is developed on top of the [[http://github.com/Amaury/Temma|Temma]] framework and the [[http://github.com/Amaury/FineBase|FineBase]] library.

You'll also need a MySQL database. Use the **etc/database.sql** file to create it.

Adapt the **etc/temma.json** configuration file.
