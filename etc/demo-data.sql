Most are created collaboratively.</p>\n\n<p>Wikis serve many different purposes, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">knowledge management</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notetaking_software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">notetaking</a>. Wikis can be community websites and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">intranets</a>, for example. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access). For example, editing rights may permit changing, adding or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may also be imposed to organize content.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ward Cunningham</a>, the developer of the first wiki software, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WikiWikiWeb</a>, originally described it as &quot;the simplest online database that could possibly work.&quot; &quot;Wiki&quot; is a Hawaiian word meaning &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;quick&quot;.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Characteristics\">Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Ward Cunningham and co-author <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Leuf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bo Leuf</a>, in their book <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiki_Way\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration on the Web</a></em>, described the essence of the Wiki concept as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A wiki invites all users to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki Web site, using only a plain-vanilla Web browser without any extra add-ons.\n</li>\n<li>Wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation almost intuitively easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not.\n</li>\n<li>A wiki is not a carefully crafted site for casual visitors. Instead, it seeks to involve the visitor in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the Web site landscape.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"History\">History</h2>\n<p>Main article: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_wikis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">History of wikis</a></p>\n\n<p>WikiWikiWeb was the first wiki. Ward Cunningham started developing WikiWikiWeb in Portland, Oregon, in 1994, and installed it on the Internet domain c2.com on March 25, 1995. It was named by Cunningham, who remembered a Honolulu International Airport counter employee telling him to take the &quot;Wiki Wiki Shuttle&quot; bus that runs between the airport\'s terminals. According to Cunningham, &quot;I chose wiki-wiki as an alliterative substitute for \'quick\' and thereby avoided naming this stuff quick-web.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Cunningham was in part inspired by Apple\'s HyperCard. Apple had designed a system allowing users to create virtual &quot;card stacks&quot; supporting links among the various cards. Cunningham developed Vannevar Bush\'s ideas by allowing users to &quot;comment on and change one another\'s text.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In the early 2000s, wikis were increasingly adopted in enterprise as collaborative software. Common uses included project communication, intranets, and documentation, initially for technical users. Today some companies use wikis as their only collaborative software and as a replacement for static intranets, and some schools and universities use wikis to enhance group learning. There may be greater use of wikis behind firewalls than on the public Internet.</p>\n\n<p>On March 15, 2007, the word wiki was listed in the online Oxford English Dictionary.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Implementations\">Implementations</h2>\n<p>Wiki software is a type of collaborative software that runs a wiki system, allowing web pages to be created and edited using a common web browser. It is usually implemented as an application server that runs on one or more web servers. The content is stored in a file system, and changes to the content are stored in a relational database management system. A commonly implemented software package is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">MediaWiki</a>, which runs this encyclopedia. See the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">List of wiki software</a> for further information. Alternatively, personal wikis run as a standalone application on a single computer. WikidPad is an example. Or even single local HTML file with JavaScript inside – like TiddlyWiki.</p>\n\n<p>Wikis can also be created on a &quot;wiki farm&quot;, where the server side software is implemented by the wiki farm owner. PBwiki, Socialtext, Wetpaint, and Wikia are popular examples of such services. Some wiki farms can also make private, password-protected wikis. Note that free wiki farms generally contain advertising on every page. For more information, see Comparison of wiki farms.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Rules\">Rules</h2>\n<p>Wikis typically have a set of rules governing user behavior. Wikipedia, for instance, has a labyrinthine set of policies and guidelines summed up in its five pillars: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia; Wikipedia has a neutral point of view; Wikipedia is free content; Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil manner; and Wikipedia does not have firm rules. Many wikis have adopted a set of commandments. For instance, Conservapedia commands, among other things, that its editors use &quot;B.C.&quot; rather than &quot;B.C.E.&quot; when referring to years prior to the common era and refrain from &quot;unproductive activity.&quot; One teacher instituted a commandment for a class wiki, &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Rule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki unto others as you would have them wiki unto you.</a>&quot;</p>','2013-03-20 16:24:22','2013-03-20 15:32:00',1,1,2,16);

Many wikis have adopted a set of commandments. For instance, Conservapedia commands, among other things, that its editors use \"B.C.\" rather than \"B.C.E.\" when referring to years prior to the common era and refrain from \"unproductive activity.\" One teacher instituted a commandment for a class wiki, \"[[Wiki unto others as you would have them wiki unto you.|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Rule]]\"','2013-03-20 16:31:22',1,9);
